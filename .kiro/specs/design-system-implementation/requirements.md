# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive design system for the HCP Onboarding application. The design system provides consistent typography, colors, spacing, component styling, and visual guidelines across the entire application. It includes standardized tokens for fonts, colors, layout dimensions, component appearances, and interactive elements to ensure a cohesive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized design system configuration, so that I can maintain consistent styling across all components and pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the design system is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide centralized configuration for typography, colors, spacing, and component styles
2. WHEN developers access design tokens THEN the system SHALL expose all design values through a structured configuration object
3. WHEN the design system is updated THEN all components SHALL automatically reflect the changes without individual component modifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a UI developer, I want standardized typography settings, so that all text elements follow consistent font families, sizes, and weights throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text elements are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply Inter font family as the primary typeface
2. WHEN headings are displayed THEN the system SHALL use defined font sizes (h1: 24px, h2: 20px, h3: 18px) with appropriate font weights
3. WHEN body text is rendered THEN the system SHALL use 14px font size with 400 font weight
4. WHEN typography tokens are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide font weights for regular (400), medium (500), and bold (700)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a consistent color palette, so that the application maintains visual coherence and brand identity across all interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI elements are styled THEN the system SHALL use the defined primary color (#3B82F6) for main actions and branding
2. WHEN status indicators are displayed THEN the system SHALL use semantic colors (success: #10B981, warning: #F59E0B, danger: #EF4444, info: #3B82F6)
3. WHEN backgrounds and surfaces are rendered THEN the system SHALL use the defined background (#F9FAFB) and surface (#FFFFFF) colors
4. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use primary (#111827) and secondary (#6B7280) text colors for proper hierarchy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want standardized spacing and layout tokens, so that I can create consistent spacing and dimensions across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spacing is applied THEN the system SHALL provide tokens for xs (4px), sm (8px), md (16px), lg (24px), and xl (32px)
2. WHEN border radius is needed THEN the system SHALL provide sm (4px), md (8px), and lg (12px) radius values
3. WHEN elevation effects are required THEN the system SHALL provide none, low, medium, and high shadow definitions
4. WHEN layout dimensions are needed THEN the system SHALL provide sidebar width (250px), header height (64px), and content padding (24px)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a component developer, I want predefined component styles, so that I can implement consistent UI elements without custom styling for each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sidebar components are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply white background, border styling, and active item states
2. WHEN header components are displayed THEN the system SHALL use defined background, border, font size, and weight
3. WHEN card components are created THEN the system SHALL apply background, border radius, shadow, and padding styles
4. WHEN buttons are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide primary and secondary button styling with defined colors and border radius
5. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL use defined line colors, fill colors, and donut chart color palette
6. WHEN badges are shown THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate colors and backgrounds for different badge types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want icon and feedback styling guidelines, so that I can implement consistent visual feedback and iconography.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN icons are used THEN the system SHALL apply outline style with 20px default size using Heroicons or custom SVG
2. WHEN notifications are displayed THEN the system SHALL use defined background and color combinations for success, error, and info states
3. WHEN feedback elements are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling across all notification types
